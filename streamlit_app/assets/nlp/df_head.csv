Full Throttle,PC,"Adventure, General","Sep 30, 2007",DaveW.,10,"I got this game when it first came out and I was about 14... I absolutely loved it then, and I probably played it through three or four times. I've just got my hands on another copy, and I was worried it might not have aged well. IT HAS. This game is still amazing - while I'll agree that it's a little short, what there is of it is so much fun to play that it's easy to forgive."

Full Throttle,PC,"Adventure, General","Dec 14, 2007",KrzysztofP.,10,"My sister brought it onced when we were kids. We haven't managed to make a big progress, and then she had to give it back to who she borrow it from. Since than, from time to time, I have been thinking of it and finaly I found it somewere and made my way through the whole story in about a week. And that was only dissapointment i get. Great story, great voices, great music, great game."
