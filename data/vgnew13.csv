As we've come to expect from these bi-annual crossover minigame collections, Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games: Tokyo 2020 packs a colorful and recognizable cast and a fair amount of fun into exciting, bite-sized mini-games that highlight some of the most iconic events in the Olympics.

With Final Fantasy 7 Remake, Square Enix breathes exciting new life into the 1997 JRPG classic in spectacular fashion. It occasionally stumbles because of some dull filler and pointlessly convoluted additions to the story, but it still manages to stand as a great RPG in itself.

Shadowlands offers some great new characters and stories, alongside the most compelling max level experience WoW has had in many years. 

With a single act of destruction, Sylvanas Windrunner has ripped open the way to the afterlife. Azeroth’s staunchest defenders have been dragged into all-consuming darkness. An ancient force of death threatens to break its bonds and unravel reality. Hidden realms of wonder and horror await any who would pass to the other side. The Shadowlands is home to an entire realm of the departed; it is a world between worlds whose delicate balance preserves life and death itself. As one of Azeroth’s greatest champions, you have been granted the power to cross over in body and soul. Now you must investigate a conspiracy to unmake the cosmos, and help Warcraft legends journey back... or fulfill their ultimate destiny.

As we've come to expect from these bi-annual crossover minigame collections, Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games: Tokyo 2020 packs a colorful and recognizable cast and a fair amount of fun into exciting, bite-sized mini-games that highlight some of the most iconic events in the Olympics. But there are also some duds, including a painful story mode. Even though the colorful and recognizable cast of characters injects a great amount of diversity and personality into the events, the relatively small retro sampling and lackluster multiplayer features hold it back from scoring Gold.

""Microsoft Flight Simulator is legitimately incredible. It's difficult to fully describe how amazing it feels to jump into a plane and fly to and from literally any place in the entire world. The base game's 20 included aircraft feel like more than enough for even hardcore aviation enthusiasts, and the ability to tailor the experience to whatever skill level you desire makes it suitable for anyone looking to fly the friendly skies from the comfort of their homes. The real-world mapping data, however, takes Flight Simulator from being just an impressive game to the most awe-inspiring and limitless simulation I've ever experienced, in spite of its less than stellar load times. Seeing famous landmarks, landing at the world's most recognizable airports, or just touching down in a remote landing strip in South America is mind-bogglingly cool and an absolutely unparalleled way to virtually explore our world."""

Spoiler-free review by Taylor Lyles.

Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City is certainly not the worst video game adaptation or even the worst Resident Evil movie, but both those bars are pretty low. Director Johannes Roberts does deserve some credit for sticking much more closely to the source material than the Paul W.S. Anderson films, but a short runtime, a rushed third act, and lack of elements to make it truly scary to watch in the dark hold it back immensely. Nevertheless, it should serve as decent fun for fans of the Resident Evil games, if only to find all the Easter eggs and references scattered throughout."

""Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 is such a tremendous turnaround from 2015's disastrously dismal Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 that it's difficult to believe they share even a shred of DNA. The accessible yet tricky skating is earnest and old school fun, the wonderful looking levels are lovingly designed odes to the past, and the music is like the hearty embrace of an old childhood buddy. It's pretty easy to be cynical about how rapidly selling us our favourite games again became a central pillar of Activision's business strategy, but when it's this much fun I'm finding it impossible to be sour about it. It turns out going backwards has been the best step forward Activision has taken with the Tony Hawk series in nearly 15 years."""

But there are also some duds, including a painful story mode. Even though the colorful and recognizable cast of characters injects a great amount of diversity and personality into the events, the relatively small retro sampling and lackluster multiplayer features hold it back from scoring Gold.

Spider-Man: No Way Home hits all the right notes as the MCU's latest entry. Its impact on the universe as a whole, as well as the overall emotional beats, all feel earned. Stellar performances meet what feels like a Saturday morning cartoon rife with all the devastating punches we've come to expect from this sneaky universe. Though it struggles with some tired superhero tropes, everything else about it will leave fans grinning ear-to-ear.

""Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 is such a tremendous turnaround from 2015's disastrously dismal Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 that it's difficult to believe they share even a shred of DNA. The accessible yet tricky skating is earnest and old school fun, the wonderful looking levels are lovingly designed odes to the past, and the music is like the hearty embrace of an old childhood buddy. It's pretty easy to be cynical about how rapidly selling us our favourite games again became a central pillar of Activision's business strategy, but when it's this much fun I'm finding it impossible to be sour about it. It turns out going backwards has been the best step forward Activision has taken with the Tony Hawk series in nearly 15 years."""

""One of the first things that struck me when I started playing Half-Life: Alyx was the dirt under Alyx Vance's fingernails. It's a simple thing, but it's not often that you see that level of fine detail in a VR game. Usually, virtual hands are either low-detail ghostly apparitions or gloved. This grit also tells us something about this character, a scrappy survivor raised in the aftermath of the Seven-Hour War in which the alien Combine conquered Earth, and it quickly establishes that she isn't as buttoned-down as that MIT-educated nerd Dr. Gordon Freeman. Subtle as it is, it sets the stage for the best VR shooter I've ever played by a mile - and one of the best in any perspective.""

""PGA Tour 2K21 is the most flexible and enjoyable golf game since EA's Tiger Woods series was at its peak. While its career mode could have done with some spit and polish to its presentation and featured more meaningful rewards, it nonetheless serves as a solid 20-hour straightaway to what could prove to be the most thriving part of PGA Tour 2K21's dance floor in the long term; the online societies. As far as establishing a new sports franchise goes (on the shoulders of the three Golf Club games that came before) this might not be the strongest shot off the tee, but it's ended up in a very playable lie."""

""Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 is such a tremendous turnaround from 2015's disastrously dismal Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 that it's difficult to believe they share even a shred of DNA. The accessible yet tricky skating is earnest and old school fun, the wonderful looking levels are lovingly designed odes to the past, and the music is like the hearty embrace of an old childhood buddy. It's pretty easy to be cynical about how rapidly selling us our favourite games again became a central pillar of Activision's business strategy, but when it's this much fun I'm finding it impossible to be sour about it. It turns out going backwards has been the best step forward Activision has taken with the Tony Hawk series in nearly 15 years."""

""A long list of quality of life improvements certainly makes the PS5 Director's Cut the most feature-rich and accessible version of Death Stranding. If you're yet to experience its gorgeous vistas and general sci-fi weirdness and you're not turned off at the thought of a 40-hour fetch quest, then this is the best way to enjoy its fiction with the least amount of friction. However, by giving us powerful new cargo-moving tools that allow us to forgo heavily burdened hikes in favour of walking the path of least resistance, it diminishes frustration at the cost of any sense of hard-earned gratification. This may be called a ""Director's Cut,"" but I can't help but feel that, for better or worse, the PS4 original perhaps more closely resembles the director's vision."""

""Like Resident Evil 2 before it, Resident Evil 3's 2020 remake does an amazing job of recapturing the horror and tension of the late '90s original while completely modernizing its gameplay. It plays like a 2020 game because it is a 2020 game. The classic world is brought to life in glorious detail, and smart level design makes exploring it a delight and replaying it almost compulsory. If only all remakes could be this good; bring on the next one.""

""Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 is such a tremendous turnaround from 2015's disastrously dismal Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 that it's difficult to believe they share even a shred of DNA. The accessible yet tricky skating is earnest and old school fun, the wonderful looking levels are lovingly designed odes to the past, and the music is like the hearty embrace of an old childhood buddy. It's pretty easy to be cynical about how rapidly selling us our favourite games again became a central pillar of Activision's business strategy, but when it's this much fun I'm finding it impossible to be sour about it. It turns out going backwards has been the best step forward Activision has taken with the Tony Hawk series in nearly 15 years."""

So, in an ironic sort of way, Battlefront 2 is a better Star Wars game because of its initial fall to the dark side and subsequent journey back to the light. After over two years of updates and changes, EA and DICE have redeemed this gorgeous shooter and turned it into one of the best multiplayer adaptations of the Star Wars universe to date.""

As we've come to expect from these bi-annual crossover minigame collections, Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games: Tokyo 2020 packs a colorful and recognizable cast and a fair amount of fun into exciting, bite-sized mini-games that highlight some of the most iconic events in the Olympics. But there are also some duds, including a painful story mode. Even though the colorful and recognizable cast of characters injects a great amount of diversity and personality into the events, the relatively small retro sampling and lackluster multiplayer features hold it back from scoring Gold.

Also available on Xbox, PC, and Nintendo Switch.

""There's no question that the three games in this GTA Trilogy are all-time classics, but they've unfortunately been remastered with a ham-hand instead of a Love Fist. New features are slight and only partially implemented, visuals are mixed, performance is inconsistent at best, some content is missing, and bugs and glitches abound. In its existing state, this collection of three classic GTA games is far from being considered definitive; it's defective, disappointing, and surprisingly disrespectful to both the legacy of the games themselves and their many legions of fans."""

""F1 2021 is the best-looking and most customisable instalment of the long-running Codemasters series to date, and the ability to tinker under the hood of the core career experience and play co-op with a friend is very welcome. With the addition of Braking Point it's also arguably the boldest F1 game so far. The characterisation is a little underdone and the E for Everyone approach means it's quite an airbrushed take on the F1 world compared to Netflix's tense and profanity-laden Drive to Survive, but injecting a story mode into the F1 series was a risk well worth taking and I'm certainly looking forward to more of it."""

""The third version of the Super Mega Baseball franchise doesn't reinvent the gameplay, which remains as grounded and easy to play as ever. However, it does add a wealth of features that make upgrading worth the price. On the field, improvements to baserunning and an emphasis on catchers' fielding make each pitch slightly more meaningful. The new Franchise mode works well, too, due in no small part to the integration of creative and easy-to-understand player traits. Developing a living roster offers interesting decisions without having to fret about financial minutia. Best of all, Super Mega Baseball 3 surrounds all of this with the most appealing graphical style, easy to use customization, fully adjustable difficulty, and quirky humor the series has become known for."""

""Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 is such a tremendous turnaround from 2015's disastrously dismal Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 that it's difficult to believe they share even a shred of DNA. The accessible yet tricky skating is earnest and old school fun, the wonderful looking levels are lovingly designed odes to the past, and the music is like the hearty embrace of an old childhood buddy. It's pretty easy to be cynical about how rapidly selling us our favourite games again became a central pillar of Activision's business strategy, but when it's this much fun I'm finding it impossible to be sour about it. It turns out going backwards has been the best step forward Activision has taken with the Tony Hawk series in nearly 15 years."""

Also available on Xbox, PC, and Nintendo Switch.

""There's no question that the three games in this GTA Trilogy are all-time classics, but they've unfortunately been remastered with a ham-hand instead of a Love Fist. New features are slight and only partially implemented, visuals are mixed, performance is inconsistent at best, some content is missing, and bugs and glitches abound. In its existing state, this collection of three classic GTA games is far from being considered definitive; it's defective, disappointing, and surprisingly disrespectful to both the legacy of the games themselves and their many legions of fans."""

Squadrons doesn't end up doing anything too memorable with its charming characters or interesting rival squadron setup, but this campaign still tells an entertaining story and its flight controls hit a sweet spot between accessibility and nuance - all made even better by VR and HOTAS support.

""PGA Tour 2K21 is the most flexible and enjoyable golf game since EA's Tiger Woods series was at its peak. While its career mode could have done with some spit and polish to its presentation and featured more meaningful rewards, it nonetheless serves as a solid 20-hour straightaway to what could prove to be the most thriving part of PGA Tour 2K21's dance floor in the long term; the online societies. As far as establishing a new sports franchise goes (on the shoulders of the three Golf Club games that came before) this might not be the strongest shot off the tee, but it's ended up in a very playable lie."""

""Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 is such a tremendous turnaround from 2015's disastrously dismal Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 that it's difficult to believe they share even a shred of DNA. The accessible yet tricky skating is earnest and old school fun, the wonderful looking levels are lovingly designed odes to the past, and the music is like the hearty embrace of an old childhood buddy. It's pretty easy to be cynical about how rapidly selling us our favourite games again became a central pillar of Activision's business strategy, but when it's this much fun I'm finding it impossible to be sour about it. It turns out going backwards has been the best step forward Activision has taken with the Tony Hawk series in nearly 15 years."""

One Piece: Pirate Warriors 4 is a great One Piece game, and though it wears its many flaws on its sleeveless, red button-down top and straw hat, its smart additions to combat go a long way in reducing the notorious tedium that typically plagues the musou genre. It's still a tough sell to a non-One Piece fan, but as someone who absolutely loves One Piece and was only just sort of into Musou games, I found a ton to like in Pirate Warriors 4.

""Forza Horizon 5 is a deep and nuanced car nirvana for revheads and auto geeks to endlessly collect, tinker, and experiment. It’s also an extremely accessible buffet of racing spectacle open to everyone, from day one, Deluxe Edition diehards to Game Pass nomads – no matter their driving skill or mechanical knowledge. It’s an occasionally goofy but always earnest Valentine to Mexico’s world-famous culture, and a romantic ode to the magic of road-tripping through postcard-perfect vacation vistas. It’s a long haul, MMO-inspired racer that’s exploding with more races, activities, and event types than can comfortably fit on the map – and yet it still always feels relaxed rather than daunting. It never locks you into something you don’t want to do and steadily rewards you for however you choose to play it. It looks beautiful, it sounds magnificent, and it is glorious to play. Yes, Forza Horizon 5 is a lot of things. Above all, however, it is the result of a racing studio at the peak of its craft and the best open-world racing game I’ve ever played.""

Reviewed by Mitchell Saltzman on PlayStation 5.

From PlayStation Studios and Bluepoint Games comes a remake of the PlayStation classic, Demon’s Souls. Entirely rebuilt from the ground up and masterfully enhanced, this remake introduces the horrors of a fog-laden, dark fantasy land to a whole new generation of gamers. Those who’ve faced its trials and tribulations before, can once again challenge the darkness in stunning visual quality and incredible performance.

""Almost since the beginning, Star Wars has been a story of redemption from darkness. So, in an ironic sort of way, Battlefront 2 is a better Star Wars game because of its initial fall to the dark side and subsequent journey back to the light. After over two years of updates and changes, EA and DICE have redeemed this gorgeous shooter and turned it into one of the best multiplayer adaptations of the Star Wars universe to date.""

""Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 is such a tremendous turnaround from 2015's disastrously dismal Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 that it's difficult to believe they share even a shred of DNA. The accessible yet tricky skating is earnest and old school fun, the wonderful looking levels are lovingly designed odes to the past, and the music is like the hearty embrace of an old childhood buddy. It's pretty easy to be cynical about how rapidly selling us our favourite games again became a central pillar of Activision's business strategy, but when it's this much fun I'm finding it impossible to be sour about it. It turns out going backwards has been the best step forward Activision has taken with the Tony Hawk series in nearly 15 years."""

""Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection is an old-school action platformer that's not too cruel to compromise, allowing you to fine tune its challenge level relative to your individual skill and tolerance for pain. Its seven-level story mode may be slightly short, but it packs in plenty of variety and unique challenges to navigate, and bolsters its replay value with the addition of the alternate Shadow levels that unlock after your first playthrough. If Capcom had added further flexibility to Arthur's movement and attacks - and maybe had some fun with the story - this would have been a truly sensational second coming, but regardless Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection is still a supremely spirited comeback."""

Narration by Akeem Lawanson. Also available on PlayStation 4, Xbox, PC, and Nintendo Switch.

NBA 2K22 makes some welcome changes to its on-court action. The new stamina system is a game-changer, leading to the series' best offensive flow in years. Defensively, the tweaks to blocks and shot contests make the paint a dangerous place to be. However, the technical issues and questionable choices and overuse of microtransactions in several of the modes keep it from being a real contender. There's a high-quality basketball sim here, but it makes more unforced errors than you'd expect for a series that's been iterating for so long.

""F1 2021 is the best-looking and most customisable instalment of the long-running Codemasters series to date, and the ability to tinker under the hood of the core career experience and play co-op with a friend is very welcome. With the addition of Braking Point it's also arguably the boldest F1 game so far. The characterisation is a little underdone and the E for Everyone approach means it's quite an airbrushed take on the F1 world compared to Netflix's tense and profanity-laden Drive to Survive, but injecting a story mode into the F1 series was a risk well worth taking and I'm certainly looking forward to more of it."""

Diablo 2: Resurrected updates the graphics of a great, classic action RPG for a new generation. It masterfully preserves the mood of a singular game, and at the same time it preserves the gameplay as it has been for over a decade - mostly for better, occasionally for worse. Unfortunately, parts of that gameplay that were standard 20 years ago just look bad now, or feel like a waste of our time. Those looking for the old king can find it right here, but they might want to politely bow rather than kneel.

""F1 2021 is the best-looking and most customisable instalment of the long-running Codemasters series to date, and the ability to tinker under the hood of the core career experience and play co-op with a friend is very welcome. With the addition of Braking Point it's also arguably the boldest F1 game so far. The characterisation is a little underdone and the E for Everyone approach means it's quite an airbrushed take on the F1 world compared to Netflix's tense and profanity-laden Drive to Survive, but injecting a story mode into the F1 series was a risk well worth taking and I'm certainly looking forward to more of it."""

Narrated by Ryan McCaffrey. Also available on Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC. 

With over 300 stages compiled and upgraded from previous games in the series, Super Monkey Ball: Banana Mania has plenty to do, but not enough of it is half as fun as I remembered it. Its levels quickly become repetitive and frustrating, and the bright, cheerful environments and silly characters aren't enough to combat the tedium of retrying aggravating levels. When you consider the various gameplay modes, difficulty levels, challenges, and unlockables, it could take dozens of hours before you see everything, though you'll likely run out of momentum long before that point. It's much more enjoyable as a local multiplayer party game, so stick to party mode - or skip it entirely.

Excellent visuals and strong performances make moments of Finch shine, but the film's lackluster story never really feels like it justifies its existence. A mashup of Castaway, The Martian, Wall-E, and I Am Legend, Finch can't quite commit to the tone or themes it wants to embody and winds up lacking a meaningful identity or message of its own.

Narrated by Ryan McCaffrey. Also available on Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC. 

With over 300 stages compiled and upgraded from previous games in the series, Super Monkey Ball: Banana Mania has plenty to do, but not enough of it is half as fun as I remembered it. Its levels quickly become repetitive and frustrating, and the bright, cheerful environments and silly characters aren't enough to combat the tedium of retrying aggravating levels. When you consider the various gameplay modes, difficulty levels, challenges, and unlockables, it could take dozens of hours before you see everything, though you'll likely run out of momentum long before that point. It's much more enjoyable as a local multiplayer party game, so stick to party mode - or skip it entirely.

Spider-Man: No Way Home hits all the right notes as the MCU's latest entry. Its impact on the universe as a whole, as well as the overall emotional beats, all feel earned. Stellar performances meet what feels like a Saturday morning cartoon rife with all the devastating punches we've come to expect from this sneaky universe. Though it struggles with some tired superhero tropes, everything else about it will leave fans grinning ear-to-ear.

""Playing Alan Wake Remastered is a bit like taking an old horror hardcover off the bookshelf and wrapping it in a glossy dust jacket; it looks brand new on the surface, but the experience of actually thumbing through it remains the same and some of the edges of of its well-loved pages are starting to look a bit dog-eared. It's therefore fairly inessential for existing Alan Wake fans, but its consistently menacing atmosphere and clever plot tricks still make for a distinctive survival-horror experience for newcomers - even if the advanced action of Remedy's most recent game has left poor Alan in its wake."""

Stellar performances meet what feels like a Saturday morning cartoon rife with all the devastating punches we've come to expect from this sneaky universe.

""Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 is such a tremendous turnaround from 2015's disastrously dismal Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 that it's difficult to believe they share even a shred of DNA. The accessible yet tricky skating is earnest and old school fun, the wonderful looking levels are lovingly designed odes to the past, and the music is like the hearty embrace of an old childhood buddy. It's pretty easy to be cynical about how rapidly selling us our favourite games again became a central pillar of Activision's business strategy, but when it's this much fun I'm finding it impossible to be sour about it. It turns out going backwards has been the best step forward Activision has taken with the Tony Hawk series in nearly 15 years."""

""Madden NFL 21 is a great example of why competition breeding innovation is a good thing. Without a comparable NFL experience on the market, EA has allowed its marquee sports franchise to fall behind in almost every significant way. In a world where its contemporary sports games continually evolve with innovative new game modes like NBA 2K20's Neighborhood, deep franchise options like MyCareer, MyTeam, and MyLeague in the NBA 2K series, or even the cinematic story mode from EA's own Fight Night Champion -- a boxing game from 2011 -- Madden's lack of innovation has reached a tipping point. There is no excuse for Madden's stagnation. I appreciate the tweaks to the core gameplay and the chaotic novelty of The Yard, but that isn't enough to make me want to sing its praises.""

""Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 is such a tremendous turnaround from 2015's disastrously dismal Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 that it's difficult to believe they share even a shred of DNA. The accessible yet tricky skating is earnest and old school fun, the wonderful looking levels are lovingly designed odes to the past, and the music is like the hearty embrace of an old childhood buddy. It's pretty easy to be cynical about how rapidly selling us our favourite games again became a central pillar of Activision's business strategy, but when it's this much fun I'm finding it impossible to be sour about it. It turns out going backwards has been the best step forward Activision has taken with the Tony Hawk series in nearly 15 years."""

""Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity offers a welcome trip back to a world I've clocked hundreds of hours in, set in a time we've only heard discussed in hushed tones. Its hugely varied roster of characters, solid combat mechanics, fun progression and clever adaptation of Breath of the Wild's vision of Hyrule is a joy to play and discover.

Spoiler-free review by Samantha Nelson.

The Wheel of Time is gorgeous, well-acted, and strongly written, a show that understands the characters and plot of Robert Jordan's books without being slavishly loyal to the source material. The first three episodes use a mix of gripping action and personal dramas to bring the pages to life while also providing an accessible introduction to series newcomers. The groundwork showrunner Rafe Judkins is laying shows he has a plan for the future. Hopefully, he will be given the time and money to see it through.

Also available on PlayStation.

I badly wanted Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance to be an awesome co-op version of the pencil-and-paper tabletop RPGs I've loved for decades, but it just isn't. It's a bland, boring trek through repetitive encounters that's filled with bugs and annoying design choices, and though it allows you to play alone you absolutely should not do that because it's an imbalanced nightmare. I can praise its faithful look and feel, which captures much of what makes Forgotten Realms a great setting, but there's very little else to recommend about this unpolished mess of a hack-and-slash RPG.

So, in an ironic sort of way, Battlefront 2 is a better Star Wars game because of its initial fall to the dark side and subsequent journey back to the light. After over two years of updates and changes, EA and DICE have redeemed this gorgeous shooter and turned it into one of the best multiplayer adaptations of the Star Wars universe to date.""

NBA 2K22 makes some welcome changes to its on-court action. The new stamina system is a game-changer, leading to the series' best offensive flow in years. Defensively, the tweaks to blocks and shot contests make the paint a dangerous place to be. However, the technical issues and questionable choices and overuse of microtransactions in several of the modes keep it from being a real contender. There's a high-quality basketball sim here, but it makes more unforced errors than you'd expect for a series that's been iterating for so long.

One Piece: Pirate Warriors 4 is a great One Piece game, and though it wears its many flaws on its sleeveless, red button-down top and straw hat, its smart additions to combat go a long way in reducing the notorious tedium that typically plagues the musou genre. It's still a tough sell to a non-One Piece fan, but as someone who absolutely loves One Piece and was only just sort of into Musou games, I found a ton to like in Pirate Warriors 4.

Spider-Man: No Way Home hits all the right notes as the MCU's latest entry. Its impact on the universe as a whole, as well as the overall emotional beats, all feel earned. Stellar performances meet what feels like a Saturday morning cartoon rife with all the devastating punches we've come to expect from this sneaky universe. Though it struggles with some tired superhero tropes, everything else about it will leave fans grinning ear-to-ear.

The story of Shenmue began 20 years ago, and for its time the original game was an undeniable marvel in video game storytelling and world-building. You lived Ryo Hazuki's life, developing relationships and maintaining a day job in your Japanese hometown, all while trying to track down your father's murderer so you could extract vengeance. Time has not been kind to that original game, nor its 2001 sequel, as video game stories and performance capture tech have improved drastically. In many ways, Shenmue 3 is a stark reminder of the leaps and bounds developers have made in the last 20 years. That's not to say there isn't a compelling experience here - it just feels out of time and doesn't reward the Shenmue faithful with meaningful revelations in the story.

""Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 is such a tremendous turnaround from 2015's disastrously dismal Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 that it's difficult to believe they share even a shred of DNA. The accessible yet tricky skating is earnest and old school fun, the wonderful looking levels are lovingly designed odes to the past, and the music is like the hearty embrace of an old childhood buddy. It's pretty easy to be cynical about how rapidly selling us our favourite games again became a central pillar of Activision's business strategy, but when it's this much fun I'm finding it impossible to be sour about it. It turns out going backwards has been the best step forward Activision has taken with the Tony Hawk series in nearly 15 years."""

Also available on Xbox One and PlayStation 4.


Whether you're listening to a tiny Acorn yodel as it transforms into a mighty Oak tree or watching a wannabe superhero zombie hold his arms aloft like Superman when he sprints, Plants vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville's roster pops with personality. Its PvE campaigns may be boring and repetitive, and its multiplayer maps can create chaotic clusters of action where it's hard to work out what's going on, but that's easy to forgive after you meet its varied and amusing cast of playable plants and zombies. Their unique abilities fill the full range of playstyles, from snipers to healers, and kept me smiling even if the modes around them never quite hit the same high bar.

""Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection is an old-school action platformer that's not too cruel to compromise, allowing you to fine tune its challenge level relative to your individual skill and tolerance for pain. Its seven-level story mode may be slightly short, but it packs in plenty of variety and unique challenges to navigate, and bolsters its replay value with the addition of the alternate Shadow levels that unlock after your first playthrough. If Capcom had added further flexibility to Arthur's movement and attacks - and maybe had some fun with the story - this would have been a truly sensational second coming, but regardless Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection is still a supremely spirited comeback."""

Also available on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Narrated by Ryan McCaffrey, edited by Michael Huynh.

""Unlike a traditional stealth game focused on keeping yourself out of view or secretly taking out unsuspecting foes at close range, in sniping games like Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts you're better off keeping your distance. It's all about reveling in the careful, precise sniping that requires methodical movements and attention to detail. Contracts, in particular, is slow at times and the obligatory escapes can be a bit boring, but the long stretches of downtime are often punctuated by exhilarating explosions of gore that make it worthwhile.""

That's more paid time off than I've ever had in my entire life! Take the weekend to rest up and be back in the Jenner on Monday, you slacker!

The Legend of Mana of 2021 is as close to the original version as you could hope for while still bringing this classic original PlayStation JRPG into the modern era. The sprite work is timeless, and the newly redrawn widescreen backgrounds are just perfect. Legend of Mana is a game I just want to look at and absorb into my eyes as much as I want to play it... maybe even moreso, because while combat holds up, the old-school structure of its story makes it a little tougher to recommend unless you're going to play with a walkthrough guide open on your phone the whole time. I enjoyed my time with Legend of Mana, don't get me wrong, but wandering through its world from one unconnected quest to the next makes reaching the end feel like a very long guessing game - and there's little or nothing that can be done to remedy that without fundamentally altering the DNA of Legend of Mana."

""Dirt 5 represents a complete about-face for the main Dirt series, shedding virtually all semblance of simulation in favour of an unabashed, arcade-inspired racing experience that draws from just about every influence you can name except its direct predecessor. It's not especially deep, and there isn't as much variety in the career mode as it claims, but it's fast, frantic, and extremely handsome, and the wild and wacky stunt track editor truly has its hooks in me."""

But it’s not the first time a shared universe of Marvel Comics characters showed up on screen. No, the FIRST MCU was in the '80s. Spinning out of the smash hit The Incredible Hulk, Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno took their small screen superhero act to the next level. This is the Inside Story of the original shared Marvel world, The Incredible MCU That Time Forgot.

The mini-doc features the Hulk himself, Lou Ferrigno, along with Eric Allan Kramer who played Thor, the original Daredevil Rex Smith, Elizabeth Gracen whose spy Jasmin was for all intents and purposes Black Widow, and writer Gerald Di Pego, who scripted two of the three films. The cast and crew talk about the original series, coming back with The Return of the Incredible Hulk, and riding that success through The Trial of The Incredible Hulk before wrapping up the trilogy with The Death of The Incredible Hulk.

While the modern Avengers have grown from “I am Iron Man” to the snap in Infinity War, to Endgame and beyond on Disney+, some of the groundwork had been laid over 40 years ago with David Banner and his alter ego the Hulk.

Narration by Mark Medina. Also available on PlayStation 4, Xbox, and PC.

Bandai Namco has hit the mark in reinvigorating the 26-year-old Tales RPG series. Tales of Arise brings to life a beautifully realized world with a story that isn't afraid to tackle heavy subjects and knows when to take its foot off the gas for a bit. Its characters feel real and relatable even in fantastical situations, and a fresh and fun combat system livens up their battles. Combined with plenty of quality-of-life improvements ironing out some of the series' long-standing frustrations, this is an easy recommendation to not just fans of the long-running series but anyone interested in diving into an expansive action-RPG.

Also available on Xbox, PC, Switch, and Stadia.

FIFA 22 heralds the next generation of virtual football, and while it doesn't reinvent the ball, the attacking and defending gameplay gains moment-to-moment fluidity. Goalkeeping blunders and visual inconsistencies aside, this year's FIFA is still one of the most nuanced and enjoyable multiplayer sports games on the market, and new additions across Career Mode and Volta Football have made FIFA's major modes more fun to play. Microtransactions still loom large, but small iterative changes and the horsepower of new-gen consoles combine to make FIFA 22 feel like a worthwhile upgrade without needing anything revolutionary or terribly exciting from EA's side.

The Wheel of Time is gorgeous, well-acted, and strongly written, a show that understands the characters and plot of Robert Jordan's books without being slavishly loyal to the source material. The first three episodes use a mix of gripping action and personal dramas to bring the pages to life while also providing an accessible introduction to series newcomers. The groundwork showrunner Rafe Judkins is laying shows he has a plan for the future. Hopefully, he will be given the time and money to see it through.

""For a story where controlling the future is a critical plot device, it's pretty ironic that Xenoblade Chronicles has never managed to get its timing right until now. After this enormous JRPG's unfortunate 2012 debut in the final days of the Wii's lifecycle and a low-res port to the 3DS that didn't do it justice, at long last it can shine on a console in its prime - and the result is an improvement as massive as the titan Bionis itself. And that's before we even get into any of the Definitive Edition's numerous improvements.""

The first three episodes are now available to stream in the US on AMC+.  For 20 years, Finn Wallace (Colm Meaney) was the most powerful criminal in London. Billions of pounds flowed through his organisation each year. But now he's dead - and nobody knows who ordered the hit. With rivals everywhere, it's up to the impulsive Sean Wallace (Joe Cole), with the help of the Dumani family headed by Ed Dumani (Lucian Msamati) to take his father's place. if the situation wasn't already dangerous enough, Sean's assumption of power causes ripples in the world of international crime. Perhaps the one man who might be able to help him and be his ally is Elliot Finch (Sope Dirsu), who up until now, has been one of life's losers, a lowlife chancer with a mysterious interest in the Wallace family. But as the wind of fate blows, Elliot finds himself transported to the inner workings of the largest criminal organisation in London.

The Wheel of Time is gorgeous, well-acted, and strongly written, a show that understands the characters and plot of Robert Jordan's books without being slavishly loyal to the source material. The first three episodes use a mix of gripping action and personal dramas to bring the pages to life while also providing an accessible introduction to series newcomers. The groundwork showrunner Rafe Judkins is laying shows he has a plan for the future. Hopefully, he will be given the time and money to see it through.
